Wiki Example Displayed

[text]
This file shows you which Wiki Syntax elements are already supported: You can
have '''bold''', ''italic'', and '''''bold italic''''' text, __underline__ or
~~strikethrough~~ words, create ^superscript^ or ,,subscript,, elements. Code
fragments can be placed {{{inline}}} - or on a separate paragraph like that:
{{{
echo "one line of code"
echo "another line"
echo "this looks better separate than inline"
}}}
You can also use headers (&lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt; in HTML) with Wiki syntax:
= Eins =
== Zwei ==
=== Drei ===
==== Vier ====
===== FÃ¼nf =====
====== Sechs ======
And if you feel your text is long enough, you may make a[[br]]break. Or even a
horizontal ruler:
----
Tables are also possible:

!!Column 1!!Column 2!!
||Next row||Next column||

Furthermore, you can have [[http://www.izzysoft.de/ links]] and embed images [[image(islogo.gif)]]

More elements may be added with the time, and existing ones may be extended...
