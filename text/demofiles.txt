The minimalist solution

[text]
The absolute minimum to use inside an input file is one title block. You will
probably never use this -- since a title without content makes no sense. So I
will skip that. The example below would just build two topics on the same level,
the titles as headers and the text as text blocks (basically this is what this
page uses - just with more blocks and more text):
[text]
{fmCodeOpen}[title]<br>First topic<br><br>[text]<br>This is the description of
the first topic. Many more lines may follow...<br><br>[topic]<br>Second topic
<br><br>[text]<br>Some text to the second topic{fmCodeClose}

#===========================================================[ simple level ]===
[title|1|simple_level]
Simple usage of title levels

[text]
In most cases, titles in FAQs have subtitles. In *pfaqmaker#, these are
represented by "levels". To get an idea of what we are talking about: In HTML,
you have headers like <code>&lt;H1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;H2&gt;</code>, and so
on. The digit in these tags is what we refer to as level. So the next example
constructs a simple page with two main titles, the first containing one
subtitle:
[text]
{fmCodeOpen}[title]<br>First topic<br><br>[text]<br>This is the description of
the first topic. Many more lines may follow...<br><br>[topic|2]<br>First
subtopic of the first topic<br><br>[text]<br>Some content for this subtopic<br>
<br>[text]<br>And some more text in a new paragraph - also for the first
subtopic<br><br>[topic|2]<br>Second subtopic of the first topic<br><br>[text]
<br>and some text for this second subtopic<br><br>[topic]<br>Second main topic
<br><br>[text]<br>Some text to the second topic{fmCodeClose}

#=============================================================[ References ]===
[title|1|references]
Using named references

[text]
Now let's go back to the minimalist variant (concerning the block count), add
a named reference to the first title, and make use of this in the text of the
second title:
[text]
{fmCodeOpen}[title|1|first]<br>First topic<br><br>[text]<br>This is the
description of the first topic. Many more lines may follow...<br><br>[topic]
<br>Second topic<br><br>[text]<br>Some text to the second topic, and a
&lt;A HREF="#first"&gt;reference&lt;/A&gt; to the first block{fmCodeClose}

#================================================================[ Plugins ]===
[title|1|plugins]
Plugins

[text]
With iFAQMaker, you also can use plugins. An example is the SQL HiLiter that
ships with the distribution. So here comes some sample of using it: I put
the SQL code in the file <code>sample.sql</code> and included it with the
plugin. The link gives you the opportunity to download the source file, while
in this text the SQL code appears hilited. In the text file, this looks like
a placeholder: <code>&#123;sqlfile("text/sample.sql")&#125;</code>, and in the
browser it looks like this:

[text]
{sqlfile("text/sample.sql")}
