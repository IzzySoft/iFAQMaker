History for iFAQMaker
=====================

v0.1.4
-------------------
+ added some hacker protection (you still should use register_globals=off
  in your php.ini for better protection!)
* invalid topics are now routed to the index page
! acronym replacement sometimes got messed up - hopefully fixed
+ added blockquotes to wiki syntax

v0.1.3 (09.03.2008)
-------------------
* variable replacement (curly braces) now also works fine for arrays up to
  two dimensions
+ added acronym support
+ added basic Wiki syntax support
! additional settings (level, aname) for [title] should have been optional.
  Now they are optional again.
+ Macros now can contain white spaces (e.g. a string for function parameters)
* plugin functions having a relative "path/to/file" as their (only) parameter
  now are registered with the class - and only for those this parameter will
  converted to an absolute path now (to allow other functions to work as
  expected)

v0.1.2 (10.02.2007)
-------------------
! lines from the textfile are no longer truncated for output (this broke
  preformatted text in previous versions)
+ added plugin interface
+ added SQL hilite plugin
+ added Shell hilite plugin
+ added PHP hilite plugin
+ added some more makros to the macros.inc file
! worked around the problem that "$1" in input textfiles always got lost
  (replaced it by &#36;)
! fixed bug in makro replacement method

v0.1.1 (25.11.2004)
-------------------
! fixed a litte HTML 4.01 compatibily issue
* some changes to the sample template to allow "overloading" of the default.css
  on top of another (site-specific) one without the nasty side-effect on the
  "back" and "index" navigator background table
+ outsourced the HTML header/footer methods to an "extension class" - this
  allows creating of "page parts" to include into another page without creating
  the HTML header/footer (and without the overhead of unneeded methods)
+ now the "tocblock" in templates is optional (specify "0" as tocstyle if it
  is missing in the template)
+ all docu (history, README, license etc.) is now in the doc/ subdirectory
+ added HTML ApiDoc (see doc/api) to the source tree
! two or more placeholders ("{}") on one line sometimes broke the parse
