History for iFAQMaker
=====================

v0.1.1
-------------------
! fixed a litte HTML 4.01 compatibily issue
* some changes to the sample template to allow "overloading" of the default.css
  on top of another (site-specific) one without the nasty side-effect on the
  "back" and "index" navigator background table
+ outsourced the HTML header/footer methods to an "extension class" - this
  allows creating of "page parts" to include into another page without creating
  the HTML header/footer (and without the overhead of unneeded methods)
+ now the "tocblock" in templates is optional (specify "0" as tocstyle if it
  is missing in the template)

v0.1.0 (17.11.2004)
-------------------
initial release
