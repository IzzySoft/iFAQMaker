This is the README file I wrote for FAQMaker v0.1.0. A complete documentation
you find after the (easy done) install -- see below -- so here is just some
general information:

===============================================================================

Contents:
---------
  1.) CopyRight
  2.) Warranty
  3.) Requirements
  4.) Pre-Requisites / Installation
  5.) Updating
  6.) Known bugs / limitations
  7.) Download and Sites

===============================================================================

1.) CopyRight (and CopyLeft)
----------------------------

  This nice piece of software is (c) 2004 by Itzchak Rehberg and IzzySoft,
  and is protected by the GNU Public License Version 2 (GPL). In short, this
  means:
  - you'll have the source code available
  - you may run this program on as many machines as you want/have
  - you may copy and distribute it as much as you want - as long as you don't
    take money for it (and keep all files together!)
  - you may edit this code to fit your needs/wishes (please, let me know about
    improvements!)
  - you may use this code for own applications - but they have to be released
    under GPL then as well.
  For details, please read the file named LICENSE in the doc/ directory.
  If you release this program e.g. in a bundle of software on CD/DVD, release
  an article about this program etc, let the author know about this. Not that
  you need an explicit permission (as long as you stick to the above terms,
  especially the GPL) - you are even encouraged to do so. I just want to be
  informed about the fact to be up-to-date about all PR taking place ;).

===============================================================================

2.) Warranty
------------

  This program is provided "as is" with no warranty (see GPL Par. 11).
  Especially this means, that the author is not responsible for any damages
  caused by the use of this software - explicitly or implicitly. The only thing
  I can guarantee you is: it will consume some disk space :)

===============================================================================

3.) Requirements
----------------

 There are a few things you have to make sure first (without them the whole
 program, including this setup, won't work at all):
 1. have a webserver running (I just tested it with Apache)
 2. have PHP running

===============================================================================

4.) Pre-Requisites / Installation
---------------------------------

 If above mentioned requirements are met, the installation is easy described
 in a single sentence: Copy all files contained in this archive to the
 desired target location inside your web tree. FAQMaker should then run out
 of the box by just pointing your browser to its index.php.

===============================================================================

5.) Updating
------------

 Same as the installation - just make sure to not overwrite some of your custom
 files ;)

===============================================================================

6.) Known bugs / limitations
----------------------------

 This is just the first beta of FAQMaker - so I expect all kind of problems ;)
 But as soon as you report them to me, I will try to have them fixed asap.

===============================================================================

8.) Download and Sites
----------------------

 If you have FAQMaker installed and running, just follow the links in the
 footers of the generated pages.

 If you have questions/suggestions, you can also contact me via email, using
 the address izzysoft@qumran.org - and please, don't give up waiting if I
 do not respond that quickly; it sometimes takes me a while :)
